 {{{ input }}}\n\nPlease read the highlighted code and check for any mistakes. You should look for the following, and be extremely vigilant:\n- Syntax errors\n- Logic errors\n- Security vulnerabilities\n- Performance issues\n- Anything else that looks wrong\n\nOnce you find an error, please explain it as clearly as possible, but without using extra words. For example, instead of saying 'I think there is a syntax error on line 5', you should say 'Syntax error on line 5'. Give your answer as one bullet point per mistake found.
